Puppet is a copy trading platform Puppets (Investors) pick and choose top traders to copy with a single deposit, follow the trades of top performers on platforms like GMX v2, with the ability and plans to expand to others. Hereâ€™s how it works:


Seamless Matching Engine: Traders continue their usual trading on GMX or directly through Puppet, without directly managing the funds of their followers. They trade with their own money, taking on the usual risks. This setup ensures that the trading experience remains seamless with symmetric risk. If traders successfully make a profit, they earn rewards in PUPPET tokens and platform if they lock their newly accured PUPPE tokens fees
