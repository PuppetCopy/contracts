Puppet use VotingEscrow both for governance and reward distribution


the tokenomics has key novel ideas; whatever comes to my head at this moment, there are possible features i had glanced over


- tokens are minted dynamically based on protocol performance without a fixed supply. this allows the protocol to mint tokens based on the value contributed by it's users
- the platform incentives users to lock their tokens to align commitment but also gives the ability to earn liquid tokens and take a quick reward if they choose to
- the protocol long term endgame is to pass ownership from the foundation to it's users where the foundation can mint 50% of the generated supply over time but the % is decreasing over time, i.e 25% will be able to minted in the second year and 15% on the third
